#### ECMA Utils

The two main modules are `is` and `cache-me`, you can grab them from either `dist/is` or `src/is` 
depending on if you don't need them transpiled in advanced. Tests run with `yarn build && yarn test`. The "is" module is very useful for validation of types and looks a lot prettier than classical JavaScript type checks. Look into the modules themselves for more information.

```bash
  npm i ecma-utils
  # or...
  yarn add ecma-utils
```
